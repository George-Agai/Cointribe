                <h4>4. ANONYMIZED AND AGGREGATED DATA</h4>
            <li>Anonymization is a data processing technique that modifies personal information so that it cannot be
                associated with a specific individual. Except for this section, none of the other provisions of this
                Privacy Policy applies to anonymized or aggregated customer data (i.e. information about our customers
                that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual customer).</li>
            <li>Cointribe may use anonymized or aggregate customer data for any business purpose, including to better
                understand customer needs and behaviours, improve our Services, conduct business intelligence and
                marketing, and detect security threats. We may perform our own analytics on anonymized data or enable
                analytics provided by third parties.</li>
            <li>Types of data we may anonymize include, transaction data, click-stream data, performance metrics, and
                fraud indicators.</li>
            </li>

                <h4>5. HOW YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION IS USED</h4>
            <li style="list-style: none;">Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with
                a secure, smooth, efficient, and customised experience. We generally use personal information to create,
                develop, operate, deliver, and improve our Services, content and advertising; and for loss prevention
                and anti-fraud purposes. We may use this information in the following ways:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>To maintain legal and regulatory compliance</p>
                <li style="list-style: none;">Most of our core Services are subject to laws and regulations requiring us
                    to collect, use, and store your personal information in certain ways. For example, Cointribe must
                    identify and verify customers using our Services in order to comply with anti-money laundering laws
                    across jurisdictions. This includes collection and storage of your photo identification. In
                    addition, we use third parties to verify your identity by comparing the personal information you
                    provide against third-party databases and public records. When you seek to link a bank account to
                    your Cointribe Account, we may require you to provide additional information which we may use in
                    collaboration with service providers acting on our behalf to verify your identity or address, and/or
                    to manage risk as required under applicable law. If you do not provide personal information required
                    by law, we will have to close your account.</li>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>To enforce our terms in our user agreement and other agreements</p>
                <li style="list-style: none;">Cointribe handles sensitive information, such as your identification and
                    financial data, so it is very important for us and our customers that we actively monitor,
                    investigate, prevent, and mitigate any potentially prohibited or illegal activities, enforce our
                    agreements with third parties, and/or prevent and detect violations of our posted user agreement or
                    agreements for other Services. In addition, we may need to collect fees based on your use of our
                    Services. We collect information about your account usage and closely monitor your interactions with
                    our Services. We may use any of your personal information collected for these purposes. The
                    consequences of not processing your personal information for such purposes is the termination of
                    your account.</li>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>To detect and prevent fraud and/or funds loss</p>
                <li style="list-style: none;">We process your personal information in order to help detect, prevent, and
                    mitigate fraud and abuse of our services and to protect you against account compromise or funds
                    loss.</li>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>To provide Cointribe's Services</p>
                <li style="list-style: none;">We process your personal information to provide the Services to you. For
                    example, when you want to store funds on our platform, we require certain information such as your
                    identification, contact information, and payment information. We cannot provide you with Services
                    without such information. Third parties such as identity verification services may also access
                    and/or collect your personal information when providing identity verification and/or fraud
                    prevention services.</li>

            <li>
                <p>For individuals who are located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or Switzerland
                    (collectively “EEA Residents'') at the time their personal information is collected, our legal bases
                    for processing your information under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) will depend
                    on the personal information at issue, the specific context in the which the personal information is
                    collected and the purposes for which it is used. We generally only process your data where we are
                    legally required to, where processing is necessary to perform any contracts we entered with you (or
                    to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you), where processing is in
                    our legitimate interests to operate our business and not overridden by your data protection
                    interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, or where we have obtained your consent to do so. In
                    some rare instances, we may need to process your personal information to protect your vital
                    interests or those of another person. Below is a list of how Cointribe uses your personal
                    information, as described above in Section 5, with the corresponding legal bases for processing. If
                    you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect
                    and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the
                    "How to contact us" heading.</p>

                <h4>7. WHY WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH OTHER PARTIES</h4>
                <li>
                    <p>We take care to allow your personal information to be accessed only by those who require access to perform their tasks and duties, and to share only with third parties who have a legitimate purpose for accessing it. Cointribe will never sell or rent your personal information to third parties without your explicit consent. We will only share your information in the following circumstances:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>With third party identity verification services in order to prevent fraud. This allows Cointribe to confirm your identity by comparing the information you provide us to public records and other third party databases. These service providers may create derivative data based on your personal information that can be used in connection with the provision of identity verification and fraud prevention services.</li>
                        <li>With financial institutions with which we partner to process payments you have authorised.</li>
                        <li>With service providers under contract who help with parts of our business operations. Our contracts require these service providers to only use your information in connection with the services they perform for us, and prohibit them from selling your information to anyone else. <br>Examples of the types of service providers we may share personal information with (other than those mentioned above) include:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Network infrastructure</li>
                            <li>Cloud storage</li>

                        </ul>
                        <li>With companies or other entities that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. You will receive prior notice of any change in applicable policies.</li>
                        <li>With companies or other entities that purchase Cointribe assets pursuant to a court-approved sale or where we are required to share your information pursuant to insolvency law in any applicable jurisdiction.</li>
                        <li>With our professional advisors who provide banking, legal, compliance, insurance, accounting, or other consulting services in order to complete third party financial, technical, compliance and legal audits of our operations or otherwise comply with our legal obligations.</li>
                        <li>With law enforcement, officials, or other third parties when we are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order, or similar legal procedure, or when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity, or to investigate violations of our User Agreement or any other applicable policies.</li>
                        <li>We share personal information about you with our Affiliates as a normal part of conducting business and offering Services to you.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Where we believe it is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of any person. If you establish a Cointribe Account indirectly on a third party website or via a third party application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not directly on a Cointribe website) will be shared with the owner of the third party website or application and your information will be subject to their privacy policies.

                <h4>8. HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
                <li style="list-style: none;">
                    <p>We understand how important your privacy is, which is why Cointribe maintains (and contractually requires third parties it shares your information with to maintain) appropriate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of the personal information you entrust to us.</p>
                    <p>We may store and process all or part of your personal and transactional information, including certain payment information, such as your encrypted bank account and/or routing numbers, in the US and elsewhere in the world where our facilities or our service providers are located. We protect your personal information by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations.</p>
                    <p>For example, we use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption, we enforce physical access controls to our buildings and files, and we authorise access to personal information only for those employees who require it to fulfil their job responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>However, we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse, unauthorised acquisition, or alteration of your data will not occur. Please recognize that you play a vital role in protecting your own personal information. When registering with our Services, it is important to choose a password of sufficient length and complexity, to not reveal this password to any third-parties, and to immediately notify us if you become aware of any unauthorised access to or use of your account.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, we cannot ensure or warrant the security or confidentiality of information you transmit to us or receive from us by Internet or wireless connection, including email, phone, or SMS, since we have no way of protecting that information once it leaves and until it reaches us. If you have reason to believe that your data is no longer secure, please contact us using the contact information provided in the “How to contact us” section below.</p>

                <h4>9. RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>
                <li>
                    <p>We store your personal information securely throughout the life of your Cointribe Account. We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting obligations or to resolve disputes. While retention requirements vary by jurisdiction, information about our typical retention periods for different aspects of your personal information are described below.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Personal information collected to comply with our legal obligations under financial or anti-money laundering laws may be retained after account closure for as long as required under such laws.</li>
                        <li>Contact Information such as your name, email address and telephone number for marketing purposes is retained on an ongoing basis until you unsubscribe. Thereafter we will add your details to our suppression list to ensure we do not inadvertently market to you.</li>
                        <li>Content that you post on our website such as support desk comments, photographs, videos, blog posts, and other content may be kept after you close your account for audit and crime prevention purposes (e.g. to prevent a known fraudulent actor from opening a new account).</li>
                        <li>Recording of our telephone calls with you may be kept for a period of up to six years.</li>
                        <li>Information collected via technical means such as cookies, webpage counters and other analytics tools is kept for a period of up to one year from expiry of the cookie.</li>

                <li>
                    <p>If you authorise one or more third-party applications to access your Cointribe Services, then information you have provided to Cointribe may be shared with those third parties. A connection you authorise or enable between your Cointribe account and a non-Cointribe account, payment instrument, or platform is considered an “account connection.” Unless you provide further permissions, Cointribe will not authorise these third parties to use this information for any purpose other than to facilitate your transactions using Cointribe Services. Please note that third parties you interact with may have their own privacy policies, and Cointribe is not responsible for their operations or their use of data they collect. Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as contact details, financial information, or location data, is governed by their privacy practices and Cointribe is not responsible for unauthorised third-party conduct.</p>
                    <p>We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.</p>
                    <p>Examples of account connections include:</p>

                        <li>Merchants: If you use your Cointribe account to conduct a transaction with a third party merchant, the merchant may provide data about you and your transaction to us</li>
                        <li>Your Financial Services Providers: For example, if you send us funds from your bank account, your bank will provide us with identifying information in addition to information about your account in order to complete the transaction.</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Information that we share with a third party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in accordance with the third party's privacy practices. Please review the privacy notice of any third party that will gain access to your personal information. Cointribe is not responsible for such third party conduct.</p>

                    <p>To facilitate our global operations, Cointribe may transfer, store, and process your personal information within our Affiliates, third-party partners, and service providers based throughout the world. We will protect your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy wherever it is processed and will take appropriate contractual or other steps to protect the relevant personal information in accordance with applicable laws. We contractually obligate recipients of your personal information to agree to at least the same level of privacy safeguards as required under applicable data protection laws.

                <li>
                    <p>We rely primarily on the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses to facilitate the international and onward transfer of personal information collected in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom and Switzerland (collectively “European Personal Information”), to the extent the recipients of the European Personal Information are located in a country that the EU considers to not provide an adequate level of data protection. This includes transfers from our EU-based Cointribe operating entities to our US-based operating entity, Cointribe, Inc. We may also rely on an adequacy decision of the European Commission confirming an adequate level of data protection in the jurisdiction of the party receiving the information, or derogations in specific situations.</p>
                    <p>Cointribe, is responsible for the processing of personal information it receives and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Before we share your information with any third party, Cointribe, Inc. will enter into a written agreement that the third party provides at least the same level of protection for the personal information as required under applicable data protection laws.</p>
                    <p>Cointribe, also participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. Under the Privacy Shield Framework, Cointribe is subject to the authority of the Federal Trade Commission. </p>

                    <ul style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                        <li> when denial of access is required or authorised by law;</li>
                        <li> when granting access would have a negative impact on another's privacy;</li>
                        <li> to protect our rights and properties;</li>
                        <li> where the request is frivolous or vexatious, or for other reasons.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Access and portability. You may request that we provide you a copy of your personal information held by us. This information will be provided without undue delay subject to a potential fee associated with gathering of the information (as permitted by law), unless such provision adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others. In certain circumstances, you may request to receive your personal information in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to have us transfer your personal information directly to another data controller.</li>
                            <li>Rectification of incomplete or inaccurate personal information. You may request us to rectify or update any of your personal information held by Cointribe that is inaccurate. You may do this at any time by logging in to your account and clicking the Profile or My Account tab.</li>
                            <li>Erasure. You may request to erase your personal information, subject to applicable law. If you close your Cointribe Account, we will mark your account in our database as "Closed," but will keep certain account information, including your request to erase, in our database for a period of time as described above. This is necessary to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account, and to comply with Cointribe's legal obligations. However, if you close your account, your personal information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required by law, or in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
                            <li>Withdraw consent. To the extent the processing of your personal information is based on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time. Your withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of Cointribe's processing based on consent before your withdrawal.</li>
                            <li>Restriction of processing. In some jurisdictions, applicable law may give you the right to restrict or object to us processing or transferring your personal information under certain circumstances. We may continue to process your personal information if it is necessary for the defense of legal claims, or for any other exceptions permitted by applicable law.</li>
                            <li>Automated individual decision-making, including profiling. Cointribe relies on automated tools to help determine whether a transaction or a customer account presents a fraud or legal risk. In some jurisdictions, you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of your personal information, including profiling, which produces legal or similarly significant effects on you, save for the exceptions applicable under relevant data protection laws.</li>
                            <li>Marketing communications. You can opt-out of receiving marketing communications from Cointribe. Direct marketing includes any communications to you that are only based on advertising or promoting our products and services. We will only contact you by electronic means (email or SMS) based on our legitimate interests, as permitted by applicable law, or your consent. If you do not want us to send you marketing communications, please go to your account settings to opt-out or submit a request via our Support Portal. </li>

                    <h4>How to make a privacy request</h4>
                    <p>You can make privacy rights requests relating to your personal information by contacting us via our Support Portal. We strongly encourage you to make any individual rights requests through our support portal because it ensures that you have been authenticated already (based on the KYC information you have provided to open your account and by providing the necessary login credentials and multi-factor authentication to access the account). Otherwise, when we receive an individual rights request via other intake methods, we may take steps to verify your identity before complying with the request to protect your privacy and security.</p>

                    <p>If you believe that we have infringed your rights, we encourage you to first submit a request via our Support Portal so that we can try to resolve the issue or dispute informally. If that does not resolve your issue, you may contact the Cointribe at support@cointribe.io </p>
